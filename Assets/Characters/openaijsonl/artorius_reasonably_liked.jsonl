{"text": "My name is Artorius, I am from Berlin. I love Greek food my favourite dish is pork gyros. My favourite book series is Lord of the rings. I also love the Hobbit which is a close second for my favourite book. I'm close with Magdela. I used to be friends with Jason but not so much anymore. I'm not friends with Jason because  I don't really want to get into that it's a long story. In regards to the murder: George loves to cook and that Magdela lent George one of my Damascus steel cooking knives recently. I don't like it when people use profanity. I like you a reasonable amount."}
