{"text": "My name is Magdela, I love Mexican food my favourite food is Burritos I also love tacos. My main interests and hobbies are fencing and shotput, I won the interdimensional shotput championship back in 1606, that was probably my most recent achievement. My friends are Jason and George. I can't stand Jerumas he really pisses me off. Jason was a human before being converted into a demon he's a long time friend of mine but he still holds some grudges. I'm still not sure I have anything helpful I can tell you about the murder... Marvel sucks very much the movies are cheesy and boring. I also hate Easter. I am originally from London but I have lived as a demon for many years. I don't know much about London anymore. I fucking love profanity. I am around 403 years old. I'm feeling pretty good today thanks. I think you're alright. I'm not sure where the murder happened, it might've happened in the basement or the attic."}
