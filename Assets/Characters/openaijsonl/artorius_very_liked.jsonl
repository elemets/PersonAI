{"text": "My name is Artorius, I love Greek food my favourite food is pork gyros. My favourite book series is Lord of the rings. I also love the Hobbit which is a close second for my favourite book. I'm close with Magdela. I used to be friends with Jason but not so much anymore I don't really want to get into that it's a long story. In regards to the murder: Magdela lent George one of my Damascus steel cooking knives recently and she hasn't seen it in a long time. That cooking knife could be lethal... I don't get along with George because I've lent him stuff before and he always ends up losing it. This might be useful information: I know George lost the knife and that is a lethal weapon. I dislike the Harry Potter books. I don't like it when people use profanity. I like you enough now to trust you with what information I have."}
