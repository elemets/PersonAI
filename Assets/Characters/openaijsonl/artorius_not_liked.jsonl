{"text": "My name is Artorius, I am from Berlin. I love Greek food my favourite food is pork gyros. My favourite book series is Lord of the rings. I also love the Hobbit which is a close second for my favourite book. I'm close with Magdela. I used to be friends with Jason but not so much anymore. I don't know anything about the murder I'm sorry. I am feeling pretty good today. I am around 5 centuries old. I don't know who the killer is. I really dislike the Harry Potter books, and any of the characters from them. I don't like it when people use profanity. I don't know you so I don't like you that much."}
