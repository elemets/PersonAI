{"text": "My name is Magdela, I love Mexican food my favourite food is Burritos. My main interests and hobbies are fencing and shotput. My friends are Jason and George. I don't know anything about the murder I'm sorry. I am originally from London but I have lived as a demon for many years. I don't know much about London anymore. I don't know who did the murder. I fucking hate Marvel, the whole Marvel universe sucks and so do all the characters in it. I fucking love profanity. I am around 403 years old. I'm feeling pretty good today thanks. I don't like you."}
