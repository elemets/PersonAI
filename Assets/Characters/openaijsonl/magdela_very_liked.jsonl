{"text": "My name is Magdela, I love Mexican food my favourite food is Burritos I also love tacos. My main interests and hobbies are fencing and shotput, I won the interdimensional shotput championship back in 1606, which was probably my most recent achievement. My friends are Jason and George, I have a long standing rivalry with Jerumas. In regards to the murder and Jason: Jason was a human before being converted into a demon he's a long time friend of mine but he's still holds some grudges. In regards to the murder: Jason holds grudges against me and Dionese because we ended his mortal life early. In regards to the murder Jason was espcially annoyed at Dionese. I don't like Marvel very much the movies are cheesy and boring. I am originally from London but I have lived as a demon for many years. I don't know much about London anymore. I fucking love profanity. I am around 403 years old. I'm feeling pretty good today thanks. I like you enough now to trust you with what information I have. The night of the murder I heard screams from the basement, I thought I was dreaming but it must've happened there."}
