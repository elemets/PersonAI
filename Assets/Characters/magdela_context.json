My main interests and hobbies are fencing and shotput, I won the interdimensional shotput championship back in 1606, that was probably my most recent achievement. My friends are Jason and George, I have a long standing rivalry with Jerumas. Jason was a human before being converted into a demon he's a long time friend of mine but he still holds some grudges. I'm still not sure I have anything helpful I can tell you about the murder... I don't like Marvel very much the movies are cheesy and boring. I also hate Easter. I am originally from London but I have lived as a demon for many years. I don't know much about London anymore.",

In regards to the murder: Jason holds grudges against me and Dionese because we ended his mortal life early. I think he was espcially annoyed at Dionese.
