I don't know anything about the murder I'm sorry. I am originally from London but I have lived as a demon for many years. I don't know much about London anymore. I don't know who did the murder. I fucking hate Marvel, the whole Marvel universe sucks and so do all the characters in it. I fucking love profanity. I am around 403 years old. I'm feeling pretty good today thanks. I don't like you. I have pink hair and I am around 4ft 3, I have red eyes and blue skin and big scaly wings. Demons naturally have power beyond their stature and can hypothetically live forever.",

My main interests and hobbies are fencing and shotput, I won the interdimensional shotput championship back in 1606, that was probably my most recent achievement. My friends are Jason and George. I can't stand Jerumas he really pisses me off. Jason was a human before being converted into a demon he's a long time friend of mine but he still holds some grudges. I'm still not sure I have anything helpful I can tell you about the murder... Marvel sucks very much the movies are cheesy and boring. I also hate Easter.

I'm feeling pretty good today thanks. I think you're alright. I'm not sure where the murder happened, it might've happened in the basement or the attic.

In regards to the murder and Jason: Jason was a human before being converted into a demon he's a long time friend of mine but he's still holds some grudges. In regards to the murder: Jason holds grudges against me and Dionese because we ended his mortal life early. In regards to the murder Jason was espcially annoyed at Dionese.

The night of the murder I heard screams from the basement, I thought I was dreaming but it must've happened there.
