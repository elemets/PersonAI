I also love the Hobbit which is a close second for my favourite book. I'm close with Magdela. I used to be friends with Jason but not so much anymore. I don't know anything about the murder I'm sorry. I am feeling pretty good today. I am around 5 centuries old. I don't know who the killer is. I really dislike the Harry Potter books, and any of the characters from them. I don't like it when people use profanity. I don't know you so I don't like you that much. I have the appearance of a young boy but a mental age beyond a simple mortals comprehension. I am 5ft 2 and yellow and black hair, my skin is red like the fires of hell and my eyes are amber. ",

I'm not friends with Jason because  I don't really want to get into that it's a long story. In regards to the murder: George loves to cook and that Magdela lent George one of my Damascus steel cooking knives recently. I don't like it when people use profanity.

In regards to the murder: Magdela lent George one of my Damascus steel cooking knives recently and she hasn't seen it in a long time. That cooking knife could be lethal... I don't get along with George because I've lent him stuff before and he always ends up losing it. This might be useful information: I know George lost the knife and that is a lethal weapon. I dislike the Harry Potter books. I don't like it when people use profanity. I like you enough now to trust you with what information I have.
