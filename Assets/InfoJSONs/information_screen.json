    "Introduction" : "You have recently come on tough times, you were kicked out by your ex because you're unemployed and have been sleeping rough since. You were washing in the local swimming pool showers when you overheard two men, one of them was talking about a job interview he wasn't going to go to, he said it was a programming job at Hergen Industries nearby and that he won't be turning up because they're not even worth his time, they both laughed and walked off. You've programmed before and think this shouldn't be too hard this strikes you as an opportunity you can't miss and you decide you're going to pretend to be him. You get yourself looking as smart as possible and decide to enter the office and see whether you can blag your way into this job. You need to find out the prospective interviewee's name, what his preferred programming language is and where he went to university. These people in the office will know some information, you need to get them to like you to get the information out of them. Good luck!",
